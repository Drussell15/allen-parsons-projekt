Mission Statement:
As people who are alive and like to stay alive- food is necessary to this goal.
However, some people have allergies or sensativities to some types of food and that is no bueno!
So we created this app to help people figure out how to cook food, buy food and avoid foods 
they may be alergic or sensitive to.
